        Lena runs a small bookstore in Brooklyn. Every Friday, she receives a
        new shipment of books.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last Friday, she received 40 books in total — 14 were mystery novels, 10
        were science fiction, and the remaining 16 were poetry collections.
      </p>

      <p>
        That evening, she sold 23 books: 8 mysteries, 7 sci-fi, and 8 poetry
        books. Her friend Max, who visited the store at 6:30 PM, noticed that
        one poetry book was missing from the shelf but wasn't recorded as sold.
      </p>

      <p>
        By Saturday morning, Lena did an inventory and found only 18 books left
        on the shelf, even though she expected 19. She checked the camera
        footage from 7:15 PM, which revealed that a customer had accidentally
        placed a poetry book among the used books pile — mystery solved!
